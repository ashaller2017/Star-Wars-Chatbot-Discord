# Star-Wars-Chatbot-Discord
a starward automated response bot for discord. 


* you basically have to train the robot on the star wars chat and save it correctly*
* then load the correctly saved pickle files to the bot.py
* from there you can either host it locally
* i will host it on an AWS server shortly so people can just download and use it
* it has some other functions like grabbing cat and dog GIFS ill probably delete or keep them as special functions
